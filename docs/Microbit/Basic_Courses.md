# BBC Micro:bit Basic Projects



## 1. What is Micro:bit?

Micro:bit is an open source hardware platform based on the ARM architecture launched by British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) together with ARM, Barclays, element14, Microsoft and other institutions. The core device is a 32-bit Arm Cortex-M4 with FPU micro-processing. 

Though it is just the size of a credit card, the Micro:bit main board is equipped with loads of components,including a 5*5 LED dot matrix, 2 programmable buttons, an accelerometer, a compass, a thermometer, a touch-sensitive logo and a MEMS microphone, a Bluetooth module of low energy, and a buzzer and others. Thus, it also boasts multiple functions. 

The buzzer built in the other side of the board plays all kinds of sounds without any external equipment. The golden fingers and gears provide a better fixing of crocodile clips. Moreover, this board has a sleeping mode to lower power consumption of batteries when users long-press the Reset & Power button on the back. It is capable of reading the data of sensors, controlling servos and RGB lights, and it is attaching with a shield so as to connect with various sensors. It also supports a variety of programming platforms and is compatible with almost all PCs and mobile devices. Also, driver is required. It is of high integration of electronic modules, and has a serial monitoring function for easy debugging.

The board has found wild applications. It can be applied in programming video games, making interactions between light and sound, controlling a robot, conducting scientific experiments, developing wearable devices. Basically, it always be utilized to make some cool inventions like robots and musical instruments.

### 1.3 Notes for the Application of Micro:bit

- It is recommended to cover it with a silicone protector to prevent short circuit for it has a lot of sophisticated electronic components.
- Its IO port is very weak in driving since it can merely handle current less than 300mA. Therefore, do not connect it with devices operating in large current, such as servo MG995 and DC motor or it will get burnt. Furthermore, you must figure out the current requirements of the devices before you use them and it is generally recommended to use the board together with a Micro:bit shield.
- It is recommended to power the main board via the USB interface or via the battery of 3V. The IO port of this board is 3V, so it does not support sensors of 5V. If you need to connect sensors of 5 V, a Micro: Bit expansion board is required.
- When using pins(P3, P4, P6, P7 and P10) shared with the LED dot matrix, blocking them from the matrix or the LEDs may display randomly and the data about sensors connected maybe wrong.
- Pin 19 and 20 can not be used as IO ports though the Makecode shows they can. They can only be used as I2C communication.
- The battery port of 3V cannot be connected with battery more than 3.3V or the main board will be damaged.
- Forbid to operate it on metal products to avoid short circuit.

To put it simple, Micro:bit V2 main board is like a microcomputer which has made programming at our fingertips and enhanced digital innovation. And as for programming environment, BBC provides a website: <https://microbit.org/code/>, which has a graphical MakeCode program easy for use.

## 3 Programming

The following instructions are applied for Windows system but can also serve as a reference if you are using a different system.

### 3.1 Procedures

This chapter describes how to write program and load the program to the Micro: Bit mainboard. Visit official website for more details: <https://microbit.org/guide/quick/>

#### 3.1.1 Step 1: Connect to Micro:bit

Connect the board to computer via USB cable. 

For how to program via mobile deceives: <https://microbit.org/get-started/user-guide/mobile/>

Multiple operation systems are compatible with this board, including Macs, PCs, Chromebooks and Linux (Raspberry Pi). 

![img](img/m11.png)

------

If the red LED on the back of the board is on, that means the board is powered. When your computer communicates with the main board via the USB cable, the yellow LED on it will flashes. For example, it will flash when you burn a “hex” file.

Then Micro: bit main board will appear on your computer as a driver named “MICROBIT(E:)”. Please note that it is not an ordinary USB disk as shown below.

![img](img/m12.png)

------



#### 3.1.2 Step 2: Write programs

Online version of Makecode: <https://makecode.microbit.org/>

Click **New Project**;

The dialog box **Create a Project** appears, fill it with **heartbeat** and click **Create √** to edit.

If you are Windows 10 system, it is also viable to edit on the APP MakeCode for micro:bit , which is exactly like editing in the website. 

Windows 10 App download: [https://www.microsoft.com/](https://www.microsoft.com/zh-cn/p/makecode-for-micro-bit/9pjc7sv48lcx?ocid=badgep&rtc=1&activetab=pivot:overviewtab)

Here we demonstrate on Google Chrome.

![img](img/m13.png)

![img](img/m14.png)

------

Write a micro:bit code. 

You can drag some **Blocks** to the editing area and then run your program in Simulator as shown below: we demonstrate how to edit **heartbeat** program. 

![img](img/m15.png)

------

Click “ JS JavaScript” to check JavaScript language.

![img](img/m16.png)

------

Click the arrow to switch to “Python” language.

![img](img/m17.png)

------



#### 3.1.3 Step 3: Download code

If your computer is Windows 10 and you have downloaded the APP MakeCode, what you will only have to do is to download the program to your Micro: Bit board.

If you are writing program through the website, following these steps:

1. Click the ‘Download’ in the editor to download a "hex" file, which is a compact program format for Micro: Bit to read;
2. Copy the "hex" file to your board. For Windows, you can also click and select ‘Send to → MICROBIT(E:) ‘to copy the hex file to the Micro: Bit board. 

![img](img/m18.png)

![img](img/m19.png)

------

Or, you may directly drag the “hex” file in **MICROBIT**.

![img](img/m20.png)

![img](img/m21.png)

During the process of copying the hex file to the Micro: bit, the yellow LED on the back of the board flashes. When the duplication is completed, the LED will stop flashing and remain on.

#### 3.1.4 Step 4: Run program

After the program is uploaded to the Micro: bit, you can power it via USB cable or an external power. Then the 5 x 5 LED dot matrix displays a heartbeat pattern.

**Power via USB**

![img](img/m22.png)

------

**Power via external 3V**

![img](img/m23.png)

**Caution:**

- When you programs each time, the driver of Micro: bit will automatically eject and return so the hex files will disappear. 
- The board only has access to hex files rather than save them.

------

#### 3.1.5 Step 5: Other programming languages

This chapter has described how to use the Micro:bit main board.

Except for the Makecode graphical programming, if you want to write Micro:bit programs in other languages, visit <https://microbit.org/code/> to learn more, or visit <https://microbit.org/projects/> to find something you want to have a go.

### Project 6:  Geomagnetic Sensor

![img](img/k48.png)

#### 1. Introduction

This project aims to explain the use of the Micro: bit geomagnetic sensor, which can not only detect the strength of the geomagnetic field, but also be used as a compass to find bearings. It is also an important part of the Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS). 

Micro: Bit main board uses LSM303AGR geomagnetic sensor, which supports four modes namely 100 kHz, 400 kHz, 1 MHz and 3.4 MHz and the dynamic range of magnetic field is ±50 gauss. In the board, the magnetometer module is used in both magnetic detection and compass. 

In this experiment, the compass will be introduced first, and then the original data of the magnetometer will be checked. The main component of a common compass is a magnetic needle, which can be rotated by the geomagnetic field and point toward the geomagnetic North Pole (which is near the geographic South Pole) to determine direction.

**Attention: this geomagnetic sensor built in the board can help us determine bearings by showing readings in the value from 0 to 360. And we need to calibrate it for the first by rotating. Please note that metal materials around may attenuate the accuracy of the reading and calibration.**

![img](img/k55.png)

We read the value to determine direction: the arrow points to the current magnetic North Pole.

![img](img/k56.png)

For the above picture, the arrow pointing to the upper right when the value ranges from 292.5 to 337.5. 

0.5 can’t be input in the code, so the values we get are 293 and 338. We add other statements to make a set of complete code.

 ### Project 7: Accelerometer

![img](img/k65.png)

#### 1. Introduction
The micro:bit board boasts a built-in LSM303AGR acceleration sensor (accelerometer) which includes standard, fast, plus and high-speed mode (100 kHz, 400 kHz, 1 MHz and 3.4 MHz) of I2C serial bus interface and SPI serial standard interface for external communication, with resolution of 8/10/12 bits and range of ±2g, ±4g, or ±8g.

When the micro:bit board is at rest or in uniform motion, the accelerometer only detects the acceleration of gravity. If the board is slightly swung, the detected acceleration is much less than the that of gravity, but the difference can be ignored. Therefore, we mainly detect the change of gravitational acceleration on the x, y, and z axes.

In this project, we will introduce how to measure the position of the board with the accelerometer. And then we may have a look at the original three-axis value output by the accelerometer.
